# The seven rules of a great Git commit message
# Keep in mind: This has all been said before.

# Separate subject from body with a blank line
# Limit the subject line to 50 characters        ^
# Capitalize the subject line
# Do not end the subject line with a period
# Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# Wrap the body at 72 characters                                      ^
# Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
